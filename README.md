geoproponis
=========

GeoProponis (loosely translated from Latin as "You present geospatially") is a framework that builds presentations and briefings out of geospatial data.

As Web-baesd and Desktop mapping software have become more user friendly and available to more than just GIS experts, it  has made Geospatial analysts out of just about everyone.  However, when sharing information from this analysis, most people still rely on screen shots and hand-written overlays.

The same tools that support most web and desktop baesd applications can also support a better visualization of this geospatial data.  Gone are the days when you send slides to your boss that include your windows status bar, hand drawn arrows, and those five online-shopping tabs you forget to close.  Geoproponis allows you to replace it with a fully-configurable, professionally designed presentation available in a variety of formats.
